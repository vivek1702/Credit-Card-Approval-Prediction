# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction
**Project Summary**

**Section 1: Questions to Answer**

In the project, I aimed to address the following questions:
1. Why is predicting good clients crucial for a bank and how does it impact the banking sector?
2. What is the significance of my proposed method in bridging the gap in knowledge for future Indian banks?

**Section 2: Initial Hypothesis**

My initial hypotheses were based on the assumption that patterns within the provided data could be used to predict credit card approvals. In the context of Data Analysis (DA) track, I aimed to identify relevant data patterns and features affecting ML model performance.

**Section 3: Data Analysis Approach**

To prove my hypotheses, I adopted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) approach to uncover key insights from the data. I justified my approach by cleaning the data, addressing missing values, and performing feature engineering. I explored patterns such as income type and education level to gauge their impact on credit card approval.

**Section 4: Machine Learning Approach**

For the machine learning aspect, I used a variety of models, including binary logistic regression, random forest, and XG Boost. I justified my selection of models based on their suitability for credit card approval prediction. Despite fine-tuning efforts, the models struggled to predict approval accurately due to data imbalance and limited relevant features.

 my proposed method could bridge knowledge gaps for future Indian banks.

**Data and Challenges:**
I tackled an imbalanced dataset with only 2% approved credit cards. I delved into two data tables: customer information and credit card approval records. The challenge lay in the scarcity of financial data, with only annual income available.

**Data Analysis:**
I cleaned the data, addressing missing values and mis-spellings. Feature engineering was vital, and I categorized data for better analysis. I explored relationships between features like housing type, family members, and creditworthiness.

**Machine Learning:**
I experimented with binary logistic regression, random forest, and XG Boost models. Unfortunately, the models struggled due to the lack of relevant data points and the data's imbalanced nature.

**Conclusion:**
While my models fell short of accurate credit card approval predictions, this project highlighted the complexities of credit assessment and the importance of comprehensive data. It serves as a stepping stone for future investigations in improving prediction accuracy and obtaining more relevant financial features.

Feel free to explore my code and analysis to gain insights into the challenges and possibilities of credit card approval prediction.
